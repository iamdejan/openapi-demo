# OpenAPI Demo

OpenAPI specification should suit the Java logic, not the other way around. However, there are not a lot of guides for this approach, which lead me to this repo.

I experiment with SpringDoc to basically try the developer experience on using OpenAPI if it was the other way around.

## Verdict

So far, so good. The annotations can be found at SpringDoc website.

### Tricky Part: Security Scheme

As I said, not a lot of tutorials on using this approach, which led me to a difficulty adding security scheme to my application.
